	OP_CONTAIN implements the MUMPS string relational operator
	"[" ("contains"):

		lhs [ rhs

	lhs ("left-hand-side") and rhs ("right-hand-side") are expressions
	interpreted as strings.  If rhs is contained exactly somewhere in lhs,
	the resulting relation is true, otherwise, false.

	On entry to this routine:
		x0 -> mval for lhs
		x1 -> mval for rhs

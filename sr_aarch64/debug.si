# Any debugging macros should be defined here

#
# Define debugging macro that verifies 8 byte stack alignment. Note this macro should be called after any initial
# stack adjustment. For example, when a routine is called via CALL, it automatically is no longer aligned due to
# the 8 byte return address on the stack. Since many routines need at least 8 bytes of save area, this is not an
# issue but for those short routines that need no saving, the 8 byte difference should be addressed before calling
# this macro.

/*
 * op_extcall calls an external GT.M MUMPS routine with no arguments. If the routine
 * has not yet been linked into the current image, op_extcall will first link it by
 * invoking the auto-ZLINK function. Before driving the function, we check if *any*
 * routines have been linked in as autorelink-enabled or if any directories are
 * autorelink-enabled and if so, drive a check to see if a newer version exists that
 * could be linked in.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 *  - arg0 (x0) - Index into linkage table of caller containing the routine header
 *		  address of the routine to call.
 *  - arg1 (w1) - Index into linkage table of caller containing the address of an
 *		  offset into routine to which to transfer control associated with
 *		  a given label. This value is typically the address of the lnr_adr
 *		  field in a label entry
 *
 * Note if arg1 is negative, this means the linkage table to use is not from the
 * caller but is contained in TREF(lnk_proxy) used by indirects and other dynamic
 * code (like callins).
 *
 * Note the return address is also supplied (on the stack) but we remove that immediately
 * since we do not return directly to it but to the the called rtn when the return address
 * is loaded out of the top M stackframe by getframe.
 *
 * Note we use w22 as a flag that we don't do more than one of auto_zlink() OR auto_relink_check()
 * call. This keeps us out of any possible loop condition as only one or the other should
 * ever be necessary. Register w22 (part of w22) is also known as REG_LITERAL_BASE and is saved by the putframe
 * macro so we need not save it separately.

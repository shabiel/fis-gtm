/* Enum of possible trace groups and types created from trace types table. The objective is to form
 * enums of the form group_type with a value of the group # in the high-order 16 bits and the trace
 * type for that group in the low-order 16 bits. This generates 3 enums given groups and types:
 *
 *   TRACE_GROUP_<group> is the enum for a given group (1, 2, 3, etc).
 *   TRCGRP_<group>      is the same as TRACE_GROUP_<group> except is is shifted into the high order 16 bits
 *                       and is used to create the value for <group>_<type>
 *   <group>_<type>      is the actual trace value used for a given group/type.

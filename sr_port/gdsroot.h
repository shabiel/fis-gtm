 * Align it to 4-byte boundary as this macro is mostly used by targ_alloc which allocates 3 keys one for gv_target->clue,
 * one for gv_target->first_rec and one for gv_target->last_rec. The alignment ensures all 3 fields start at aligned boundary.
 * In the following macro, we can ideally use the ROUND_UP2 macro but since this is used in a typedef (of "key_cum_value")
 * in gdscc.h, we cannot use that macro as it contains GTMASSERT expressions to do the 2-power check. To avoid this,
 * we use the ROUND_UP macro (which has no checks). It is ok to do that instead of the more-efficient ROUND_UP2 macro
 * as the second parameter is a constant so all this should get evaluated at compile-time itself.

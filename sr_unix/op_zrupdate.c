/* The ZRUPDATE command drives this routine once through for each argument (object file path and object file - potentially
 * containing wildcards). Each file specified, or found in a wildcard search, is separated into its path and its routine name;
 * the path is then looked up and the appropriate relinkctl file opened, where we find the routine name and bump its cycle.
 *
 * Although this routine is set up to handle a variable argument list, more than 1 argument is not currently supported. The
 * ZRUPDATE command itself does support a commented list of filespecs, but the compiler turns each argument into a separate
 * call to this routine. The purpose of the variable argument list is to support a future proposed enhancement, which would
 * allow a ZRUPDATE argument to be a parenthesized list of filespecs with the intention that all of them be simultaneously
 * updated. Such a list, when supported, would be passed as a list of files to this routine - hence the multi-arg support.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   argcnt        - currently always 1 (see note above).
 *   objfilespec   - mval address holding string containing filespec to process.
 *
 * No return value.

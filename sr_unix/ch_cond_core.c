/* Create our own version of the DUMP macro that does not include stack overflow. This
   error is handled better inside mdb_condition_handler which should be the top level
   handler whenever that error is raised. I would add an assert for that but this would
   force mdb_condition_handler to be included in all the images we build forcing them
   to be larger than they should be by pulling in the transfer table referenced in
   mdb_condition_handler. Not doing the dump here does not prevent the core from occuring,
   it just delays where it would occur should ERR_STACKOFLOW be signaled from a utility
   routine for some reason. Note that the DUMP macro below is defined in error.h and is
   expanded as part of the DUMPABLE macro below (10/2000 se).

   Since ERR_STACKOFLOW has the type of fatal, we must explicitly check that this error
   is NOT ERR_STACKOFLOW. 1/2001 se.
   The ERR_MEMORY error now gets same treatment as ERR_STACKOFLOW 2008-01-11 se.

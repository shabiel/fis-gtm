/* Routine to drive ydb_cip() in a worker thread so YottaDB access is isolated. Note because this drives
 * ydb_cip(), we don't do any of the exclusive access checks here. The thread management itself takes care
 * of most of that currently but also the check in LIBYOTTADB_INIT*() macro will happen in ydb_cip()
 * still so no need for it here. The one exception to this is that we need to make sure the run time is alive.
 *
 * Parms and return - same as ydb_cip() except for the addition of tptoken and errstr.
